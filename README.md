## About
> Pushalot is the best application for sending free push notifications to Windows 8 and Windows Phone 7 and 8, using this very simple API for PHP.

> Pushalot PHP Class is a PHP wrapper class for using the Pushalot (https://pushalot.com) REST API. Have a look at their API docs (https://pushalot.com/api) for more information about all the parameters.
